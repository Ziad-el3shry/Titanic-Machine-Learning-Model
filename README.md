# 🛳 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning models. It is based on the popular [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

## 📂 Project Overview
- Built with Python using libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Achieved a model accuracy of **80.5%**.
- Includes preprocessing, data visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- (You can add more if you used others like SVM or KNN)

## 📊 Visualizations
- Survival distribution by gender, class, and age
- Correlation heatmap
- Feature importance from models

## 📁 Dataset
You can download the dataset from Kaggle:

🔗 [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

Place the downloaded `train.csv` or `titanic.csv` file in the project directory.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-ML-Project.git
